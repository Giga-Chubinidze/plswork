# Instructions

A final project in scripting language course at KIU

In order to successfully run this rails application you must do the following

* clone it

* install all the used libraries via "bundle install"

* migrate the databases with "rails db:migrate"

* start the server with "rails s"

* if this doesn't work, then the fault is someplace else
